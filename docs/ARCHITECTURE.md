# Architecture

Vroom HR is a FastAPI + Next.js application with PostgreSQL, Redis, MinIO, and
Google/OpenAI integrations. Backend code lives under `backend/src/modules/` and
currently contains active modules for identity, employee, Gmail, and
recruitment. Attendance, leave, payroll, and ESS are retired from the active
backend as of migration `027_drop_attendance_payroll_tables.py`; their product
specs remain archived under `docs/product/`.

## Discovery Before Shape

Before proposing implementation shape, identify:

- Product surfaces: browser, mobile, desktop, CLI, API, worker, or service.
- Runtime stack: language, framework, database, queues, providers, and hosting.
- Core domains: the product concepts that deserve stable names and contracts.
- Boundary inputs: user input, API requests, webhooks, jobs, files, credentials,
  provider payloads, and environment configuration.
- Validation ladder: the smallest checks that can prove the selected stack.

Record stack choices in `docs/decisions/` when they meaningfully constrain
future work.

## Default Layering

```text
domain
  <- application
      <- infrastructure
          <- interface
              <- app surfaces
```

## Backend Module Structure

```text
backend/src/modules/<module_name>/
├── api/            # FastAPI routers, schemas, error handlers
├── application/    # Service layer and use cases
├── domain/         # SQLModel entities, enums, exceptions
├── infrastructure/ # Repositories, provider clients, config
└── container.py    # FastAPI dependency wiring
```

New backend modules must follow this structure unless an ADR explicitly chooses
a different boundary.

## Dependency Rule

Inner layers must not depend on outer layers.

| Layer | May depend on | Must not depend on |
| --- | --- | --- |
| domain | nothing project-external except tiny pure utilities | framework, database, UI, provider, process/env |
| application | domain | framework, UI, provider, database concrete clients |
| infrastructure | domain, application | interface controllers or UI |
| interface | all backend layers | UI state or platform shell assumptions |
| app surfaces | API contracts and app-facing clients | domain internals directly |

## Parse-First Boundary Rule

Unknown data must be parsed at boundaries before it enters inner code.

Boundaries include:

- HTTP request bodies, params, and query strings.
- Session payloads and identity claims.
- Environment variables.
- Database rows returned from external clients.
- Platform shell payloads.
- Deep links, tokens, and signed URLs.
- Provider webhooks, events, and async payloads.

Target flow:

```text
unknown input
  -> parser
  -> typed DTO or command
  -> application use case
  -> domain object/value object
```

Inner layers should work with meaningful product types such as `UserId`,
`AccountId`, `WorkspaceId`, `Role`, `DateRange`, or domain-specific IDs,
rather than repeatedly validating raw strings.

## Command/Query Boundary

If the product has both reads and writes, keep command/query separation clear at
the code level even when the storage layer is simple:

- Commands mutate state and own audit side effects.
- Queries read state and format for consumers.
- Shared domain rules live in domain/application, not controllers.

## Observability Contract

The future server should emit one canonical JSON log line per request with:

- timestamp
- level
- request_id
- user_id when known
- action
- duration_ms
- status_code
- message

Audit logs are product records. Application logs are operational records. Do not
use one as a substitute for the other.
